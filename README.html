<h1>StacighStudios (that&rsquo;s Finnish for Easy)</h1>

<p>Hi. I&rsquo;m a starter theme called <code>StacighStudios</code>, which is based off of <code>underscores</code>. I&rsquo;m a theme meant for hacking so don&rsquo;t use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for.</p>

<p>I may have started out as another <code>underscores</code> project but I&rsquo;m also packaged with <code>H5BP</code> and <code>Unsemantic Grid System</code>. My CSS stylesheet is built with SCSS so you&rsquo;ll need to have at least a basic understanding of how to use SASS/Compass.</p>

<ul>
<li>A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.</li>
<li>A helpful 404 template.</li>
<li>A sample custom header implementation in <code>inc/custom-header.php</code> that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found in the comments of <code>inc/custom-header.php</code> to your <code>header.php</code> template.</li>
<li>Custom template tags in <code>inc/template-tags.php</code> that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.</li>
<li>Some small tweaks in <code>inc/extras.php</code> that can improve your theming experience.</li>
<li>A script at <code>js/navigation.js</code> that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It&rsquo;s enqueued in <code>functions.php</code>.</li>
<li>Smartly organized starter CSS in <code>style.scss</code> that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.</li>
<li>Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Download <code>StacighStudios</code> from github. The first thing you want to do is copy the <code>StacighStudios</code> directory and change the name to something else - Like, say, <code>megatherium</code> - then you&rsquo;ll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Search for: <code>&nbsp;stacighstudios</code> (with a space before it) and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code> (with a space before it)</li>
<li>Search for: <code>StacighStudios</code> and replace with: <code>Megatherium</code></li>
<li>Search for: <code>stacighstudios</code> and replace with: <code>megatherium</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Then, update the stylesheet header in style.css and the links in footer.php with your own information.</p>

<h2>Optional IE7 Support</h2>

<p>Still need to support IE7? (You poor soul!) In style.scss, you&rsquo;ll be presented with this variable: <code>$legacy_support_for_ie: false;</code>. All you have to do is set it to <code>true</code>. Bam. Instant IE7 support.</p>

<h2>H5BP</h2>

<p>Love the <code>HTML 5 Boiler Plate</code>? Yeah! So do I! And, as you see, in case you still need to support IE7, I got your back. Need to support less than IE7? Ouch, bro. I can&rsquo;t help you out of the box but feel free to fork and modify.</p>

<h2>Modernizr</h2>

<p>Modernizer&rsquo;s great if you still have to support legacy browsers. But almost all HTML5/CSS3 features have been implemented by modern browsers. However, there are still a handful of CSS and HTML features that are unsupported by IE9. For this reason, I&rsquo;m rollin' with a custom version of Modernizr that will add support for <code>text-shadow</code>, <code>transition</code> and the <code>placeholder</code> attribute. You know&hellip; in case you absolutely have to have fallbacks for these features. Need to support less than IE9? Download a custom build of <code>Modernizr</code> and overwrite the <code>modernizer.custom.js</code> file from <code>/js/vendor/</code></p>

<h2>Unsemantic</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m built on Unsemantic Grid System but I&rsquo;ve been slimmed down quite a bit (by over 1500 lines of code). Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing out of the box: IE7 support, Prefix &amp; Suffix and Push &amp; Pull. If you don&rsquo;t need to support IE7 and don&rsquo;t use push/pull or prefix/suffix, you won&rsquo;t notice a difference. However, I&rsquo;ve come pre-packaged with some options for you in case you can&rsquo;t live without prefix/suffix and push/pull Unsemantic features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t need any of these extra features? No probs. Make sure <code>_layout-slim.scss</code> is imported (section 2.0 of style.scss)</li>
<li>Need to use Prefix/Suffix (white space)? Import <code>_layout-p2.scss</code></li>
<li>Need to use everything, including IE7? Import <code>_layout.scss</code> and don&rsquo;t forget to set <code>$legacy_support_for_ie</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>I come packaged with Tablet and Mobile breakpoints. Defaults:
* Mobile Max Width: 767px
* Tablet Min Width: 768px
* Tablet Max Width: 1024px
* Desktop Min Width: 1025px
* Desktop Max Width: 1200px</p>

<p>But these can be easily changed in the style.scss file.</p>

<h2>Normalize</h2>

<p>Forked version from @kristerkari; for more information: https://github.com/kristerkari/normalize.scss</p>

<p>I come packaged with an SCSS version of Normalize for editing ease. Program your sitewide settings in the style.scss file &ndash; Settings like font properties, heading sizes, colors and buttons can be customized up front without hunting through the entire series of stylesheets to change settings.</p>

<h2>Underscores</h2>

<p>All the best stuff from Underscores has been left intact! The CSS has been cleaned up a bit but it has been pretty much left untouched.</p>
